All software for a computer from scratch

The purpose of this project is to create every piece of software required to make a computer work, for educative purposes.

I do not claim to do things in a proper, correct or interesting way. I am exploring and trying different options from innexperience.

The only software that I do not pretend to use are the assemblers and linkers, since I do not have freedom to explore how they should work.
Perhaps drivers from linux will be salvaged at some point?

Right now there are no instructions to build this project at home. Basically I followed a few tutorials from wiki.osdev.org

Anyway, if you are interested do contact me anyway you fancy.
